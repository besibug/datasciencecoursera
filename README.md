# Course Project - UCI HAR Dataset

This repository contains the class project for the Coursera Course
[Getting and Cleaning
Data](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning). After downloading
tha [UCI HAR
Dataset](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip),
an analysis was done, performing the following tasks:

### Task

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the
following.

1.  Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.  Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation
    for each measurement.
3.  Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data
    set
4.  Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5.  Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each
    variable for each activity and each subject.

### Contents

This repo contains the R-code, the created tidydata-set and a Codebook
with more info about the analysis and used variables.

### Unused Files

The .zip also contained “Inertial Signal”- files, that were not needed
for this specific analysis.
